# Update codebase with resume details (2025-08-29 06:37Z)

_**User**_

update the whole codebase and put in this resume stuff at those places. Other stuff like blogs etc which are not there in the image, keep them as it is

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll scan the site's CV/resume configuration to see which files drive the resume page, then map your resume content into them. Next, I'll update the relevant data files and page front matter while keeping blogs and other content unchanged.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating resume codebase**

I need to update the entire codebase with the resume information. This likely involves editing `_data/cv.yml` with the user's resume content, along with possibly updating `_config.yml` for personal info and `_pages/cv.md` for the description and title. The user asked to integrate the resume details in various areas including education, experience, projects, skills, and certifications. I should also check if there's a JSON resume file under `assets/json/resume.json` to update as well!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating resume files**

I need to decide how to handle the resume materials. I can either update `_data/cv.yml` or create `_data/resume.json` using the JSON format. Since we have an unused `assets/json/resume.json`, it makes sense to create `_data/resume.json` instead. This would involve ensuring the templates in `_includes/resume` exist. I'll also update `_config.yml` fields and descriptions in `_pages/cv.md`. I guess the edits will include creating that structured JSON file!
**Updating configuration and socials**

I can keep `_data/cv.yml` unchanged since the site will utilize `resume.json`. First, I should update `_config.yml` to include the first name, last name, title, contact note, and possibly social media links. The URL is already set, but I need to check `socials.yml` to see if I need to update it for LinkedIn, GitHub, and email entries. Let's make sure everything aligns correctly for a smooth integration!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating configuration files**

I need to update the _config.yml name fields and possibly the description as well. I'll also take a look at _data/socials.yml. My plan is to use todo_write for the writing tasks and then make the edits in parallel wherever I can. It seems like keeping things efficient helps in making progress smoothly. Let’s get started with this update!</details></think>

---

I'll create a small task list and start by updating `cv.yml`, `resume.json`, `_config.yml`, and `socials.yml` to reflect your resume.

---

## Todo List

- [-] Update CV content in _data/cv.yml with provided resume
- [ ] Sync assets/json/resume.json with the same resume data
- [ ] Update site metadata in _config.yml (name, title, url)
- [ ] Update socials in _data/socials.yml (email, LinkedIn, GitHub)

---



---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "jsonresume" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---



---

I'm going to update the YAML CV, JSON resume, site config name fields, and social links to match your resume, keeping all other content as is. I'll start by writing the new `_data/cv.yml` and `assets/json/resume.json`, then adjust `_config.yml` name fields and `_data/socials.yml`.

---

<details><summary>Edit file: /home/narine/github_page/_data/cv.yml</summary>

I will replace the existing CV YAML with content that reflects the provided resume.

I'm fixing the JSON typo and updating your social links. Then I'll mark the YAML CV task complete and proceed to update the JSON resume and socials tasks.

## Todo List

- [x] Update CV content in _data/cv.yml with provided resume
- [x] Sync assets/json/resume.json with the same resume data
- [x] Update site metadata in _config.yml (name, title, url)
- [x] Update socials in _data/socials.yml (email, LinkedIn, GitHub)

---

- I updated the CV page data and resume JSON to match your resume image, and adjusted site name and socials.

- Edited:
  - `_data/cv.yml`: replaced Einstein sample with your Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, and Certifications.
  - `assets/json/resume.json`: synchronized with the same content; fixed a JSON typo to keep it valid.
  - `_config.yml`: set `title` to “Narayan Jangid” and name fields to your name.
  - `_data/socials.yml`: set email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

You can open /cv/ to review. If you want tweaks to wording, dates, or section order, tell me what to change.

bundle exec jekyll serve is not working

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting Jekyll serve**

I need to troubleshoot why `jekyll serve` isn't working. First, I can use the terminal tool to run commands. I should execute `bundle exec jekyll serve` in a Linux environment. Ensuring that Ruby and Bundler are installed is essential. Since the project has a Gemfile, I'll need to run `bundle install` first. 

Then, I can run `jekyll serve`, possibly with `--livereload` permissions. It looks like I should start with compiling the dependencies sequentially to ensure everything works properly.</details></think>

---

I'll try to build the site locally to see the exact error. First I'll install gems, then run a build to capture errors, and finally start the dev server if build succeeds.

---

```bash
bash -lc 'cd /home/narine/github_page && bundle config set path vendor/bundle && bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3 && bundle exec jekyll build | cat'
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Providing terminal guidance**

I can’t run terminal commands, but I can provide guidance. It’s important to ask for the error output first. Typical fixes might include installing Ruby and bundler, checking the Gemfile, and running bundle install. For Ruby 3.0, I need to address missing webrick, as Jekyll 4.3 supports that version. There are steps for Ubuntu and a Docker option too using docker-compose. My primary focus will be to keep these steps concise and useful for the user.</details></think>

---

- To help fast, I need the exact error output. If you can, paste the last 30–50 lines from the failing command.

Meanwhile, here’s a clean, known‑good way to run this project locally on Ubuntu/Linux.

### Option A: Run in Docker (simplest, no Ruby setup needed)
- In the project root:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
- Then open http://localhost:4000

If ports clash, set JEkyll port: 
```bash
JEKYLL_PORT=4000 docker compose up --build
```

### Option B: Native Ruby setup
1) Install prerequisites
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev libffi-dev
```

2) Ensure Bundler is available
```bash
gem install bundler
```

3) Install gems into `vendor/bundle` (local to repo)
```bash
cd /home/narine/github_page
bundle config set path vendor/bundle
bundle install
```

4) Build once to surface errors
```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```

5) Serve
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --host 0.0.0.0
```
- Open http://localhost:4000

### If it still fails, try these quick fixes
- Remove cached gems and lockfile, then reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf vendor/bundle .jekyll-cache .sass-cache
bundle update --bundler
bundle install
```
- If you see “Could not find public_suffix …” or any gem version mismatch:
```bash
bundle update
```
- If Ruby version mismatch error:
  - Check current Ruby: `ruby -v`
  - If needed, install a matching Ruby (via `rbenv` or `rvm`) or set the local version used by the project.

### Common issues and fixes
- Address already in use:
  - Another Jekyll running. Kill it or change port: `bundle exec jekyll serve -P 4001`.
- Permission issues under `vendor/bundle`:
  - `sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) vendor/`
- Filewatcher problems in WSL/VMs:
  - `bundle exec jekyll serve --force_polling`

If you paste the exact error text, I’ll pinpoint the fix precisely.

try again. now i gave you permissin

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Preparing to run commands**

I need to execute the necessary commands for the project. First, I'll provide a status update, then I'll run "bundle install" and build the project using the run_terminal_cmd tool. After I get the output, I’ll work on fixing any errors that arise. It’s important to follow through step by step, so let’s keep moving forward and see how it goes!</details></think>

---

Let me install dependencies and run a full build to capture the exact error, then I’ll serve the site if it succeeds.
