### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Narayan Jangid  
AI & ML Engineer with hands-on experience building production-grade GenAI, multimodal systems, and forecasting pipelines.  
Currently exploring **LLM efficiency** across pre-training, post-training, and inference, with a strong focus on **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** transformers, **CUDA Kernel Optimizations** and **LLM Cache Handling Techniques**.  
Iâ€™m also diving deep into **CUDA/PTX** and **parallel programming** to optimize large-scale training and deployment.  
My research interests span **agentic AI, scalable inference, and advanced language modeling architectures**.  
Always curious about pushing the boundaries of what large models can do in real-world applications.
